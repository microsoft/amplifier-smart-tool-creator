This is a Smart Tool that must conform to Microsoft's [Amplifier Smart Tool Spec](https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-smart-tools).

## Orientation

- If not already, set up the environment by following docs/DEVELOPMENT.md. It also has every command for linting, formatting, type checking, testing, and running the conformance kit.
- After making changes, `prek run --all-files` and `uv run pytest` must pass before the work is done.
- `docs/00-vision.md` is the source of truth for what this tool is and is not. Then `README.md` and `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`, then the rest of `docs/`. When work changes any of them, propose the doc updates at the end and call out contradictions.
- The library is the tool. Every capability lives in the library and is reachable from `lib.py`. The CLI and any other surface are thin wrappers: argument parsing and I/O conventions, then a call into the library. Capability that exists only in a wrapper is a defect.
- Deterministic capabilities run with no model provider configured. Model-backed capabilities go through the `Intelligence` interface, never an SDK directly, and their help text says they are model-backed.
- A capability is its code, a row in `CAPABILITIES`, and a `SKILL.md` beside that code carrying its arguments, a worked invocation, its result, and its failures. `<command> --help` renders that skill, `<command> -h` stays the terse generated summary, and the tool's own skill stays a router pointing at both.
- Failures name what went wrong and how to fix it. The caller is usually an agent.
- Never modify this file unless explictly told.

## Writing Style

- Be concise. The user will not read walls of text.
- When adding to existing documents, add only what's needed.
- Do not restructure or rewrite existing content unless asked.
- Always prefer code blocks and other formatting over tables.
- Match the tone and density of what's already in the file.
- Never write em dashes

## Python Development Instructions

- This is a production-grade Python project using `uv` as the package and project manager. You must *always* follow best Python practices.
  - To figure out how `uv` works, start by using `uv --help`.
- Make sure any comments in code are necessary. A necessary comment captures intent that cannot be encoded in names, types, or structure. Comments should be reserved for the "why", only used to record rationale, trade-offs, links to specs/papers, or non-obvious domain insights. They should add signal that code cannot.
- The current code in the package should be treated as an example of high quality code. Make sure to follow its style and tackle issues in similar ways where appropriate.
- Don't generate characters that a user could not type on a standard keyboard like fancy arrows (layout trees are fine)
- Anything is possible. Do not blame external factors after something doesn't work on the first try. Instead, investigate and test assumptions through debugging through first principles.
- `ty` by Astral is used for type checking. Always add appropriate type hints such that the code would pass ty's type check.
- Follow the Google Python Style Guide.
- NEVER add imports to __init__.py files. Leave them empty unless absolutely necessary.
- Always prefer pathlib for dealing with files. Use `Path.open` instead of `open`.
- When using pathlib, **always** Use `.parents[i]` syntax to go up directories instead of using `.parent` multiple times.
- When writing tests, use pytest and pytest-asyncio.
- Prefer using loguru for logging instead of the built-in logging module. Do not add logging unless requested.
- NEVER use `# type: ignore`. It is better to leave the issue and have the user work with you to fix it.
- Don't put types in quotes unless it is absolutely necessary to avoid circular imports and forward references.
- When adding new dependencies, you **must** use `uv add <package>`. AFTER that, update the `pyproject.toml` to follow the convention for versions like the other dependencies.
- When constructing long strings like prompts for LLMs, use `python-liquid`'s `render` function:
```python
from liquid import render

print(render("Hello, {{ you }}!", you="World"))
# Hello, World!
```
- To learn about how packages work, you should read from the relevant source code. This is especially important when determining which types to use.
- Run `prek run --all-files` when you are done with code changes and fix everything it reports; it runs the lock, lint, format, and type checks.
- NEVER add a bare `*,` keyword-only marker to a function signature. Write plain positional-or-keyword parameters and call them by keyword.
